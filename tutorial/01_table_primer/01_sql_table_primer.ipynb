    "SQL is about relational theory in practice. A relation is mapped to a table in the SQL world (but some authors say these entities are not the same). You may read more about [\"The SQL Standard – ISO/IEC 9075:2023 (ANSI X3.135)\"](https://blog.ansi.org/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2023-ansi-x3-135/).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in SQLAlchemy there is a `class sqlalchemy.schema.Table` for mapping an object/instance of this class to a table in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It needs a table name and metadata. Generally, metadata are data that describe data like the format, structure and so on. In SQLAlchemy, the term “metadata” typically refers to the [MetaData](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/metadata.html#sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData) construct, which is a collection of information about the tables, columns, constraints, and other [DDL](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/glossary.html#term-DDL) (Data Definition Language) objects that may exist in a particular database ([link](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/glossary.html#term-database-metadata)).\n",
