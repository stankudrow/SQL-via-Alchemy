    "All right, we know how to interact with a database via aiosqlite DB-API, but how does it relate to SQLAlchemy? Long story short: there are different vendors of databases like PostgreSQL, Oracle and so forth. They have their SQL versions, called SQL-dialects, that must be compatible with the ANSI SQL standard, but not coherent with one another. For instance, a mere `SELECT 1+1;` query will be valid for PostgreSQL, but will fail when processed by Oracle - for Oracle you need `SELECT 1+1 FROM DUAL` query.\n",
