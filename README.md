# SQL-via-Alchemy

Learning SQL via SQLAlchemy database toolkit.

The Structured Query Language ([SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)) was designed to interact with [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) via relational database management systems ([RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS)). It is possible to use raw SQL in the code, but in this tutorial the [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) object-relation mapping ([ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)) tool plays a key role when working with databases within the code. Database migrations will be also covered via [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) tool designed to be used in pair with the SQLAlchemy.
